# Location Tracker

I am interested in tracking my location data to learn all kind of interesting things about my behaviour. 
However, I do not want to give up this data to some tech company. So I cobbled together this little
server that can receive the http requests from the [Owntracks](https://owntracks.org/) mobile app.

In the future I would like to be able to have a nice visualization of where I spend my time.

## TODO

- &#x2612; Receive data from mobile app
- &#x2610; Save data to sqlite database
- &#x2610; Visualize data on a nice map
